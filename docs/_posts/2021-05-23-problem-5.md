## Meh.
Find the smallest integer that evenly divides (meaning no remainder) all integers from 1 to 20. This one you can do by hand. Factor each number into prime factors. Find the least common multiple of all of the factors.

This problem gets interesting as the range of integers grows. What is the smallest integer that evenly divides 1 - 1000? What are all the primes from 1 to 1000?
