## Find the difference between the sum of squares for numbers 1 -> 100 and the square of the sum of numbers 1 -> 100.

The sum of numbers 1 to 100 can be considered as an arithmetic sequence of 100 terms. The difference, d, between each successive term is 1. The nth term of the sequence is the first term plus (n-1) * d. The sum of these terms is an arithmetic series described as the number of terms, n, multiplied by the sum of the first and nth term, divided by 2. German mathematician Gauss, a child prodegy, applied this formula in grade school.

For this problem the first term is the square of the sum of 1 to 100 (an arithmetic series).
100 * (1 + 100) / 2 = 5050
5050 ** 2 = 25502500

The second term is the sum of squares for 1 to 100. This is a sum of a sequence of square pyramidal numbers. A pyramid of bricks with a base 100 * 100 bricks and successive layers of 99 * 99 bricks, 98 * 98 ... might be expressed n * (n-1) * (2n - 1) / 6 for a number of levels n.
100 * 101 * 201 / 6 = 338350
