## Find the sum of all prime numbers less than two million
A simple way to find this solution is to scan numbers from one to two million and test for primality. Or scan only odd numbers. I applied the Miller-Rabin algorithm from problem 7 to test for primes. This approach was effective, but slow. Another simple way is using the Sieve of Eratosthenes to make a list of primes and sum them up. In the Project Euler forums, other Eulerians found solutions based on the Meissel-Lehmer algorithm.
