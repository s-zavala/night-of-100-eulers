## Day 3 Problem 3
#### Wow that became difficult quickly.
Alright problem 3. You kicked my butt. Find the largest prime factor of 600,851,475,143. I attempted this problem the same way as I proceeded with problems 1 and 2. Generate a sequence of numbers. Filter the sequence with a test. Perform an operation on the filtered sequence to return an answer. The Project Euler website states that each problem can be computed in less than a minute and I stopped my program after three or four minutes.

I had to reconsider what is a better way of evaluating whether or not a number is prime? Is there a more efficient way to see if one number is the factor of another? I was stumped. The site also says that problem order is intentional. Each one builds off of what you learned from doing the last. Maybe I missed something about multiples or even Fibonacci numbers. So I went to the site forum for problem 2 and the discussion made me realise there is so much to learn about the properties of these numbers. For starters every third Fib number is even. A quick wikipedia search provides many interesting properties of the Fib sequence and sure enough they also relate to prime numbers.

I think I am on the right track. Tomorrow I want to read the wiki page for Modular exponentiation and watch the Khan academy Cryptography video on Fermat's primality test. Maybe that will be enough of a foundation to write this script.
